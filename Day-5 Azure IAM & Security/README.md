# üìò **Day-5: Azure Identity, Security & Monitoring**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**

* Cloud-based identity & access management (IAM)
* Manages users, groups, roles, applications
* Supports SSO (Single Sign-On) & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

* Assign roles to users, groups, or service principals
* Control access to resources in subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Managed Identity**

* Provides an identity for Azure services to access resources securely
* Eliminates the need for credentials in code

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Key Vault**

* Centralized secrets management (keys, passwords, certificates)
* Integration with VMs, Functions, App Service, AKS

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Security Center / Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

* Unified security management
* Threat protection for VMs, databases, and applications
* Security recommendations and compliance tracking

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Policy**

* Enforce rules and compliance for resources
* Example: enforce storage accounts to use encryption

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Monitor**

* Collects metrics, logs, and diagnostics from resources
* Can create alerts and dashboards

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Log Analytics Workspace**

* Central repository for log data
* Supports Kusto Query Language (KQL) for analysis

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Application Insights**

* Monitor application performance, errors, and telemetry
* Works with web apps, functions, AKS containers

## üîü **Hands-On Practice**

* Create users and groups in Azure AD
* Assign RBAC roles to a resource group
* Enable managed identity on a VM or Function
* Store a secret in Key Vault and access it from a VM or Function
* Enable Azure Monitor on a VM and check metrics
* Create a simple Application Insights resource and view telemetry
